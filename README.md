This repository has the training and deployment code as well as trained models for the paper

["Zero-Shot Transfer of Haptics-based Object Insertion Policies"](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12587) - Samarth Brahmbhatt, Ankur Deka, Andrew Spielberg, and Matthias MÃ¼ller, ICRA 2023.

The code is divided into sections.
- [`rl`](rl): Simulation environment and training framework.
- [`robosuite`](robosuite): Fork of [`robosuite`](https://robosuite.ai) which implements policy inference delay randomization.
- [`ros_controllers`](ros_controllers): ROS package implementing operational space control for the Frank Emika Panda robot.
- [`ros_drivers_utils`](ros_drivers_utils): [Soft Robotics mGrip](https://www.softroboticsinc.com/products/mgrip-modular-gripping-solution-for-food-automation/) gripper ROS driver, and some other utilities.
- [`arduino`](arduino): [Soft Robotics mGrip](https://www.softroboticsinc.com/products/mgrip-modular-gripping-solution-for-food-automation/) gripper control circuit and Arduino code.
