This repository has the training and deployment code as well as trained models for the paper

["Zero-Shot Transfer of Haptics-based Object Insertion Policies"](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12587) - [Samarth Brahmbhatt](https://samarth-robo.github.io), [Ankur Deka](https://ankur-deka.github.io), [Andrew Spielberg](http://www.andrewspielberg.com), and [Matthias MÃ¼ller](https://matthias.pw), ICRA 2023.

The code is divided into directories.
- Simulation training:
  - [`rl`](rl) (entry point): Simulation environment and training framework, including reproduction of the ICRA 2023 paper.
  - [`robosuite`](robosuite): Fork of [`robosuite`](https://robosuite.ai) which implements policy inference delay randomization.
- Real robot deployment:
  - [`ros_controllers`](ros_controllers) (entry point): ROS package implementing operational space control for the Frank Emika Panda robot.
  - [`ros_drivers_utils`](ros_drivers_utils): [Soft Robotics mGrip](https://www.softroboticsinc.com/products/mgrip-modular-gripping-solution-for-food-automation/) gripper ROS driver, and some other utilities.
  - [`arduino`](arduino): [Soft Robotics mGrip](https://www.softroboticsinc.com/products/mgrip-modular-gripping-solution-for-food-automation/) gripper control circuit and Arduino code.
